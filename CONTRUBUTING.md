# Contributing

If you want to work on any of the open issues, leave a comment that you are working on it, that way you are sure that
no one else is working on it. If you end up not working on the issue anymore, leave another commend that you stopped
working on the issue (no worries).

If you have an improvement, or you found a bug, feel free to open an issue.

When you have worked on an issue, go ahead and open a pull request.

New features/bug fixes should include a passing test.

Thank you for wanting to contribute!
